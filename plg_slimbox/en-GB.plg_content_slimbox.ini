SLIMBOXDESCINPLUGIN=Slimbox is a visual clone of the popular Lightbox JS v2.0 by Lokesh Dhakar, written using the ultra compact mootools framework. It was designed to be small, efficient, more convenient and 100% compatible with the original Lightbox v2. For more information, see http://www.digitalia.be/software/slimbox <br /><br /><strong>How to use</strong><br /><br /><blockquote>{slimbox images/img_1.jpg,images/timg_1.jpg,Things I like; images/img_2.jpg, images/timg_2.jpg, Why does this happen to me?; images/img_3.jpg,images/timg_3.jpg, when will it end?; images/img_4.jpg,images/timg_4.jpg}</blockquote><br /><br /> - To use the plugin, simply type the above into your Joomla! article.<br /><br /> - You can have multiple {slimbox x,x,x } galleries.<br /><br /> - Or, you can show only a single image with slimbox.<br /><br /> - Each image string can have three parts separated by the comma: "," -- the regular sized image, the thumbnail and the caption.<br /><br /> - You must specify the first two values; if you do not have a thumbnail to display, simply repeat the name of the regular sized image.<br /><br /> - Images must be specified from the baseURL, absent the first slash, and should not have quotes (Correct: images/amy.jpg -- Incorrect: "/images/amy.jpg")<br /><br /> - Captions should follow the second image and a comma and should not have quotes or commas or semicolons.<br /><br /> - If you do not want captions for a specific image, or if you do not want captions for any of your images, you can simply omit the third part of the image string.<br /><br /> - Image strings must be separated by the semicolon: ";"<br /><br /> - On the webpage, itself, you can display all of the thumbnails or only the first. If you only want one thumbnail to show, add the word "single" in lowercase, following the "{slimbox" literal.<br /><br />Please let me know of any problems you might have.
